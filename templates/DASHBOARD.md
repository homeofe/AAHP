## 🔄 Update Instructions (for agents)

After completing any task:

1. Update the relevant row to ✅ with current date
2. Update test counts
3. Update "Pipeline State"
4. Move completed task out of "Open Tasks"
5. Add newly discovered tasks with correct priority

**Pipeline rules:**
- Blocked task → skip, take next unblocked
- All tasks blocked → notify the project owner
- Notify project owner only on **fully completed tasks**, not phase transitions
- On test failures: attempt 1–2 self-fixes before escalating
