<!-- SECTION: summary -->
AAHP **v3.10.0** (npm `@elvatis_com/aahp`) is prepared on a review branch. It has not
been tagged, published, or merged. The release changes Layer 2 in two bounded ways:

- CI diffs are anchored to an explicit base commit. Pull requests pass their base SHA,
  pushes pass the event `before` SHA, and manual runs require an input. Missing, zero,
  invalid, unreadable, HEAD-equal, and undiffable bases fail closed.
- An optional `handoffImpact.nonImpactingModifiedFiles` list can classify one exact
  content-only regular tracked-file modification (`M`) as non-impacting when the old and
  new Git modes match and it carries a visible review reason. A/D/R/C, mode changes,
  mixed source changes, config changes, and handoff changes remain impacting. The
  Node/Python runtime parser and schema reject unsafe, invisible, or ambiguous policy.

The actor-wide dependency-bot workflow bypass is removed. Layer 1 now runs for every
actor. The package now includes the workflow that `propagate.sh` installs. The gate
remains verify-only and never regenerates handoff state.

## Build Health

| Check | Result | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| npm version | READY | package, lockfile, changelog, CLI help, and handoff surfaces set to 3.10.0 |
| `tests/handoff-impact.bats` | FOCUSED PASS | 24 pass + 3 Windows skips; empty base, staged/CI endpoint modes, parser parity, M-only, A/D/R/C, mixed and diff failures pass; schema passed separately; symlink case awaits Linux CI |
| `tests/propagate.bats` | FOCUSED PASS | 2/2; source checkout and installed npm tarball propagate byte-identical gate, parser, and workflow |
| `tests/verify.bats` | FOCUSED PASS | 22/22 under Git Bash with explicit CI bases |
| schema validation | FOCUSED PASS | example and repository config both validate against the updated schema |
| shell syntax | FOCUSED PASS | changed shell scripts parse under Git Bash |
| `npm run check` | PASS | changelog, version sync, claims, forbidden patterns, schema/doc sync, doc links, and handoff freshness |
| shellcheck | FIXED, CI RERUN PENDING | first Linux run caught SC2015/SC2016 in the new parser; idiom corrected and intentional JS quoting scoped |
| full Bats suite | CI | deliberately not run on Windows; Linux CI is authoritative |

## Components

| Component | Path | State | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------|-------|
| Verify gate | `scripts/verify-handoff.sh` | Changed | explicit base, fail-closed diff, name-status classifier |
| Shared library | `scripts/_aahp-lib.sh` | Changed | Node/Python runtime parser for reviewed impact config |
| Required workflow | `.github/workflows/aahp-verify.yml` | Changed | no actor bypass; explicit base; read-only token; immutable action pins; evaluator-path trust boundary documented |
| Config schema/example | `schema/aahp-config.schema.json`, `aahp.config.example.json` | Changed | additive `handoffImpact` contract |
| CLI | `bin/aahp.js` | Changed | verify help documents `--base SHA` |
| Specification | `README.md` | Changed | Section 2.8 and ADR-018 define the contract |
| Rollout | `scripts/ROLLOUT.md` | Changed | consumer propagation and mutation checks documented |
| Release surfaces | `package*.json`, `CHANGELOG.md` | Changed | v3.10.0 prepared, workflow included in npm artifact, not released |

## What is Missing

| Gap | Severity | Description |
|-----|----------|-------------|
| Linux CI evidence | HIGH | Required before merge; the full suite and shellcheck belong on the hosted Linux runner. |
| Release | NORMAL | Do not tag or publish until review is merged and the release ceremony is explicitly authorized. |
| Evaluator path protection | HIGH | The supplied `pull_request` workflow executes proposed workflow and gate code. A consumer must require trusted review for evaluator paths or supply a default-branch evaluator; v3.10.0 cannot configure repository rules. |
| Delete-both-sides Layer 1 hole | MEDIUM | Pre-existing: removing a canonical handoff file and its index entry still needs a required-set protocol decision. |
| Windows CI runner | MEDIUM | Pre-existing: Git Bash behavior is locally focused-tested, but CI remains Linux-only. |

## Next Actions

1. Regenerate `MANIFEST.json` and run the focused repository gates.
2. Push the review pull request replacement head and let hosted Linux CI run the full suite and shellcheck.
3. Do not tag, publish, or merge from this session.
